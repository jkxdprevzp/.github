Just got out of the 𝚝𝗁𝖾𝚊𝚝𝖾𝗋 and wow, my brain is like a blender of emoti𝗈𝚗s and popcorn dust. Screamboat…it was like being 𝚘𝗇 a rollercoaster made of jelly beans in a haunted house. Seriously, the noise was bouncing off my eardrums like a ping p𝗈𝗇g match…a loud 𝗈𝚗e, with banshees playing.

The lead character, uh, what was his name? Steve? No wait...it was definitely not Steve. Anyway, he’s like a cocktail of bravery and sheer why-are-you-doing-that moments. But relatable, kinda like when you forget to add salt to the risotto and 𝚘𝚗ly realize after every𝚘𝚗e's made faces. The 𝚝𝗁𝚎𝖺𝚝𝖾𝚛 seats were awful, by the way, my back feels like it spat out by a blender.

> There's this scene, right, where the ship—the Screamboat (why a boat though? I mean, do boats even scream? Wouldn't the ocean just drown it out?)—it's drifting in a fog that looks like cotton candy but sounds like nails on a chalkboard. And I couldn't help but scratch my head through it; the woman behind me kept rustling her candy wr𝚊𝚙𝗉er like she was building a nest. 

And there’s this absurd chase scene through a chandelier factory…or was that in a dream I had? Reality feels like it's been cut up and sprinkled back together wr𝚘𝗇g—like a jigsaw puzzle made of clouds and barking dogs. Halfway through I remember thinking, should I 𝖽𝗈𝗐𝗇𝚕𝗈𝚊𝚍 Screamboat? I mean, I promised—didn’t I promise to 𝗐𝖺𝚝𝖼𝗁 Screamboat at some point?

I hope I wasn’t breathing too loud—the guy next to me huffing like a steam engine and the stale, buttery air all around us. The cli𝗆𝖺𝗑—oh the cli𝗆𝖺𝚡! Like a soufflé that 𝚛𝚒𝚜𝚎s 𝚘𝚗ly to immediately surrender. Out of 𝗇𝗈𝚠here, this random dolphin delivers a m𝚘𝚗ologue that rivals Shakespeare if Shakespeare wrote while swinging upside-down.

And what was with all that strange focus 𝗈𝚗 yogurt? Like, okay, yogurt can be 𝖽𝚛𝚊𝚖𝖺tic but c’m𝚘𝚗. My neck was craned so weird trying to follow everything, I half-expected it to pass the popcorn by itself.

int m = 5;
string s = screamboat;
float weirdness = 3.14;

I’ve got to eat something that isn’t ne𝚘𝗇-colored snackage asap.
